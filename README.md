## Overview

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It includes two gameplay modes: single-player mode where you play against a simple computer algorithm, and multiplayer mode where two players can take turns. The game is built using core Java and demonstrates basic concepts like conditional logic, loops, arrays, and formatted console output using ANSI escape codes.

## Features

### Two Gameplay Modes:

- Single-player mode against a computer Algo.
- Multiplayer mode for two human players.

### Interactive Console Interface:

- Color-coded output using ANSI escape codes for a better visual experience.
- Clear visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

### User Input Validation:

- Checks for invalid moves like entering the same spot twice or numbers out of range.

### Computer Algo:

- A simple algorithm that picks the first available valid move.
- Gives the feeling of playing against a basic AI that responds in real time.
